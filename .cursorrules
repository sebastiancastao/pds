# Employee Time Tracking System - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This application is designed to track employee time and worker availability for PDS, replacing manual processes with a compliant, automated system.

## Business Divisions
- **PDS Vendor** - Primary staffing and event services
- **CWT Trailers** - Trailer Rental Division (only affects Module 1 - clock in/out)

## Current Risks (Manual Process)
- Onboarding via paper/email ‚Üí PII stored without encryption, not compliant
- Managers entering time instead of employees ‚Üí not FLSA-compliant
- Spreadsheets for payroll closeout ‚Üí no audit trail, risk under IRS/DOL rules
- Gmail used for company email ‚Üí not SOC2/PII compliant
- No enterprise backups or monitoring ‚Üí exposure to data loss and breach liability

---

## System Modules

### Module 1 ‚Äì Onboarding, Availability & Time Tracking (Custom Portal)

**Regulations:**
- I-9, W-4, W-9, handbook acknowledgments must be securely stored
- FLSA requires employees to record their own hours

**Scope:**
- Applies to **all employees**: PDS Vendor, CWT Trailers, and salaried employees from both divisions
- **Onboarding packets provided by State** - each state requires different packages for tax purposes

**Features:**
- Secure electronic onboarding with encrypted storage
- Employee-driven login/logout with email/password and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Break attestation for CA/state wage law compliance
- Workers see gross pay visibility per event, per pay date
- Audit-ready exports: payroll CSV and PDF logs

**Gains:**
- Eliminates manual onboarding packets
- Reduces manager data entry
- Streamlines compliance checks
- Operational Efficiency: Eliminates manual onboarding packets, reduces manager data entry, streamlines compliance checks

---

### Module 2 ‚Äì Event Creation & Staffing (Custom Portal)

**Created By:** Room Managers

**Features:**
- Event creation with required details (venue, date/time, type)
- Staff pulled from compliant worker directory
  - **Vendor compliance requirement:** Workers must have completed onboarding process and submitted all required documents
- Invites sent via email/SMS/in-app with 24h acceptance window
- Event dashboard showing: assigned, confirmed, open slots
- Ticket sales per event entry for right-size staff planning

**Event Dashboard Fields:**
- Event name
- Artist
- Artist Share %
- Venue Share %
- PDS Share %
- Tax bracket by city, state

**Gains:**
- Operational Efficiency: Replaces ad-hoc scheduling with automated workflows, reducing errors and back-and-forth communication

---

### Module 3 ‚Äì Global Calendar (Custom Portal)

**Features:**
- Consolidated view across all venues/managers
- Visibility by venue and globally
- Calendar views: day/week/month
- Color-coded by venue/type/status
- Overlays for staffing coverage

**Permissions by Role:**
- **Execs** = global view
- **Managers** = venue-only
- **Workers** = "My Events"

**Gains:**
- Operational Efficiency: Provides real-time scheduling visibility across the entire organization, eliminating duplicate planning and manual spreadsheets

---

### Module 4 ‚Äì Event Closeout & Payments (Custom Portal)

**Inputs:**
- Sales
- Commission pool
- Tips
- Reg/OT/DT hours

**Payout Logic:**
- Wages + commission should not exceed 4% commission pool (unless exception occurs)
- Tips distributed separately
- Any deficit flagged if wages fall below minimum wage floor

**Approval Chain:**
- Manager ‚Üí Finance

**Integration:**
- Approved payouts exported as CSV upload to ADP for payroll processing
- Workers see approved gross pay lines by event/paydate in "My Pay"
- **Note:** Payroll continues to process in ADP; payouts approved in system first, then uploaded as CSV

**Gains:**
- Operational Efficiency: Eliminates manual payroll calculations and spreadsheet reconciliations; ensures faster, more accurate payroll closeout

---

## IT & Security Layer (Interop IT LLC)

**Infrastructure Changes:**
- Migration of PDS email from Gmail to Microsoft for SOC2/PII-compliant hosting
- Shared Google Docs/Sheets migrated to Microsoft Word/Excel for secure storage
- Microsoft Email fee included in monthly IT/Security fee

**Security Features:**
- 24√ó7 endpoint monitoring & patching
- Local + cloud backups with restore testing
- Ransomware/malware defense with rollback protection
- SOC2-compliant Vercel hosting for portal
- Monthly compliance reports for insurers/regulators

**Gains:**
- Operational Efficiency: Reduces IT overhead, consolidates platforms (Gmail/Google Drive ‚Üí Microsoft Outlook/Word/Excel), automates system health monitoring

---

## Compliance Standards

**Regulations Addressed:**
- FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act)
- I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification)
- W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate)
- W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification)
- CA/State wage law compliance
- IRS/DOL audit requirements
- SOC2 compliance
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection

---

## Timeline
Estimated 4‚Äì6 weeks including testing before full deployment

---

## System Summary

**Current State:** Manual process = not compliant (PII handling, wage/hour tracking, Gmail for PII, payroll audit gaps)

**New Platform Ensures:**
1. Secure onboarding & time tracking (FLSA/CA compliant)
2. Ticket-driven staffing forecasts
3. Venue + global scheduling visibility
4. Audit-ready payroll closeout with CSV upload to ADP
5. Microsoft email + secure Word/Excel storage replacing Google Docs/Sheets included in IT/Security fee
6. Payroll continues in ADP with approved payouts uploaded as CSV for accuracy and compliance

---

## Development Guidelines

### Security First
- All PII must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Implement secure authentication (email/password with MFA for all users)
- Follow SOC2 compliance standards
- Ensure audit trails for all critical operations

## üîê PII Data Handling & Security Compliance

### PII Data Collection & Classification

| Category              | Examples                                               | Sensitivity Level |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| üìã Employment Forms   | I-9, W-4, W-9, Direct Deposit, Handbook acknowledgment | **High**          |
| üë§ Worker Identifiers | Worker ID, Name, Email, Phone                          | **Moderate**      |
| üîë Authentication     | Email, hashed password, MFA secret, backup codes       | **High**          |
| üìä Onboarding Status  | Onboarding completion status, timestamps               | **Low**           |

**Note:** I-9, W-4, W-9, bank information, and authentication credentials (passwords, MFA secrets) qualify as **high-sensitivity PII** and **financial information**, requiring secure handling and compliance.

### System Design for PII Handling

#### Backend/Database Security
- Encrypt all sensitive fields (name, phone, email, onboarding status)
- Store files (W-4, I-9, etc.) in **encrypted object storage** (e.g., AWS S3 with SSE-KMS)
- Use environment-based access segregation (dev/staging/prod)
- Implement database-level encryption for PII columns

#### Access Control & Authentication
- All users must use **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** - required for all roles
- Email/password authentication with TOTP-based MFA (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Logs must be immutable and timestamped
- Field-level permissions (e.g., payroll staff can access Direct Deposit, not I-9)
- Principle of least privilege for all user roles
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Password requirements: minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- MFA backup codes provided during setup

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Log all access to high-sensitivity forms with user identification
- Use anomaly detection (e.g., excessive downloads, off-hours access)
- Real-time alerts for suspicious activity
- Quarterly security audits and access reviews
- Immutable audit trail for compliance verification

### User Privacy Obligations (CPRA/GDPR-Aligned)

For users in California or EU, implement:

| Feature                 | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| üîç Data access request  | Let users request what data you store about them      |
| ‚ùå Data deletion request | Allow full deletion, respecting form retention laws   |
| üìù Purpose limitation   | Collect only data necessary for onboarding/compliance |
| üìë Privacy notice       | Explain collection, storage, and usage clearly        |
