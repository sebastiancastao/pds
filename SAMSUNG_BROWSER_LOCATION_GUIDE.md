**Fix:**

2. Clear Samsung Browser data:
   - Menu → Settings → Sites and downloads → Remove site data
3. Refresh page and try again
4. Make sure URL starts with `https://`

### Issue 3: "Location Unavailable"

**Symptom:** Location request times out

**Causes:**

### Issue 4: "Location Services Require HTTPS"
