# 📱 Mobile Location Permission - Quick Fix Guide

**Issue:** Location permission not appearing on mobile browser  
**Solution:** Follow these steps based on your device

---

## 🚨 MOST IMPORTANT: Check Your URL

Location **ONLY works on HTTPS or localhost!**

### ✅ **Working URLs:**
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/login`
- `https://your-domain.com/login`
- `http://localhost:3000/login` (dev only)

### ❌ **Won't Work:**
- `http://your-ip-address:3000/login`
- `http://your-domain.com/login`

**If using HTTP:** Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for automatic HTTPS!

## 🧪 Test If Location Works

### Quick Test:

2. Go to: https://www.openstreetmap.org/
3. Tap the GPS/location icon (usually top right)
4. Browser should ask for permission
5. If it works here → Your browser supports location!

### If OpenStreetMap works but PDS login doesn't:

**Most likely causes:**
1. ❌ Site is using HTTP (not HTTPS)
2. ❌ Permission was denied earlier (need to reset)
3. ❌ Site is in browser's blocked list

5. See: `✓ Location obtained`
6. See: `✓ Location verified`
7. Login continues

### Error Messages Explained:

- Compliance requirement
- Prevents unauthorized remote access
- Creates audit trail

**Privacy:**
- Location only checked at login
- Not tracked continuously
- Stored securely in database
- Used only for security/compliance
