## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email not received"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Spam/junk folder
2. ✅ Email address typed correctly
3. ✅ Resend Dashboard → Emails → Check delivery status
4. ✅ Terminal console for error messages

**Common Causes:**
- Email in spam folder (most common!)
- Typo in email address
- Recipient's email server blocking
- Resend API key incorrect

### Issue: "Resend error" in Console

**Check:**
1. API key is correct in `.env.local`
2. Dev server was restarted
3. No typos in API key
4. Resend account is active

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify API key in .env.local
cat .env.local | grep RESEND

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Email goes to spam"

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify your domain** (best solution)
   - Go to Resend Dashboard → Domains
   - Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
   
2. **For now:** Tell users to check spam folder

3. **Long-term:** Domain verification improves deliverability to 99%+
