# Fix: Prevent Access to Onboarding Pages After MFA Setup

## Security Issue Fixed

### Problem:
Users at `/verify-mfa` (without entering MFA code) could navigate to `/register` or `/mfa-setup` and bypass the MFA verification requirement.

**Example Attack:**
```
1. User logs in → Redirected to /verify-mfa
2. User types /register in URL bar (without entering MFA code)
3. ❌ SECURITY ISSUE: User can access /register without MFA verification!
4. User can then navigate to other pages, bypassing MFA
```

### Root Cause:
The `AuthGuard` on `/register` and `/mfa-setup` used:
```typescript
<AuthGuard requireMFA={false} allowTemporaryPassword={true}>
```

This configuration meant:
- ✅ Session required
- ❌ MFA NOT required
- ✅ Temporary passwords allowed

**The problem:** These pages were accessible to ANY authenticated user, regardless of whether they had completed MFA setup or not.

---

## Solution: `onboardingOnly` Prop

### New AuthGuard Prop

Added a new `onboardingOnly` prop to `AuthGuard`:

```typescript
interface AuthGuardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  requireMFA?: boolean;
  allowTemporaryPassword?: boolean;
  onboardingOnly?: boolean; // NEW: Only accessible during initial onboarding
}
```

### How It Works

When `onboardingOnly={true}`:

1. **Check if user has MFA secret** (completed MFA setup)
2. **If MFA secret exists** → User has completed onboarding
   - ❌ Block access to onboarding-only pages
   - Redirect to `/verify-mfa` to complete verification
3. **If NO MFA secret** → User is still in onboarding
   - ✅ Allow access to complete onboarding

---

## Implementation

### AuthGuard Logic (Step 3)

**File:** `lib/auth-guard.tsx` (lines 57-84)

```typescript
// Step 3: Check if page is onboarding-only (should redirect if MFA already set up)
if (onboardingOnly) {
  console.log('[AUTH GUARD] Checking onboarding status (page is onboarding-only)...');
  
  // Check if user has already set up MFA
  const { data: profileDataArray } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('mfa_secret')
    .eq('user_id', session.user.id)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
    .limit(1);
  
  const profileData = profileDataArray?.[0] || null;
  
  // If user has MFA secret, they've completed onboarding
  if (profileData?.mfa_secret) {
    console.log('[AUTH GUARD] ⚠️ User has completed onboarding (MFA secret exists)');
    console.log('[AUTH GUARD] ❌ Onboarding-only page not accessible, redirecting to /verify-mfa');
    router.push('/verify-mfa');
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('[AUTH GUARD] ✅ User in onboarding phase, allowing access to onboarding page');
}
```

### Updated `/register` Page

**File:** `app/register/page.tsx` (line 298)

```typescript
<AuthGuard 
  requireMFA={false} 
  allowTemporaryPassword={true} 
  onboardingOnly={true}  // ← NEW
>
  {/* Registration form */}
</AuthGuard>
```

**Protection:**
- ✅ Session required
- ❌ MFA NOT required (part of onboarding)
- ✅ Temporary passwords allowed
- ✅ **Only accessible if user hasn't set up MFA yet**

---

### Updated `/mfa-setup` Page

**File:** `app/mfa-setup/page.tsx` (line 226)

```typescript
<AuthGuard 
  requireMFA={false} 
  allowTemporaryPassword={true} 
  onboardingOnly={true}  // ← NEW
>
  {/* MFA setup with QR code */}
</AuthGuard>
```

**Protection:**
- ✅ Session required
- ❌ MFA NOT required (user is setting up MFA)
- ✅ Temporary passwords allowed
- ✅ **Only accessible if user hasn't set up MFA yet**

## Security Flow Comparison

### Before (Vulnerable):

```
User logs in → Redirected to /verify-mfa
↓
User types /register in URL
↓
❌ Can access /register (no MFA check)
↓
User navigates around, bypassing MFA
```

### After (Secure):

```
User logs in → Redirected to /verify-mfa
↓
User types /register in URL
↓
AuthGuard checks: Has user set up MFA?
  ├─ Yes (has mfa_secret) → ❌ BLOCKED → Redirect to /verify-mfa
  └─ No (no mfa_secret) → ✅ ALLOWED (still in onboarding)
```

---

## User Journey Flows

### Flow 1: New User (First Time)

```
1. Log in with temporary password
   ↓
2. Redirect to /password (change password)
   ↓
3. Navigate to /register
   ↓
   AuthGuard checks:
   - Session? ✅ Yes
   - Temp password allowed? ✅ Yes
   - Has MFA secret? ❌ No
   ↓
4. ✅ ACCESS GRANTED to /register
   ↓
5. Complete registration
   ↓
6. Navigate to /mfa-setup
   ↓
   AuthGuard checks:
   - Session? ✅ Yes
   - Temp password allowed? ✅ Yes
   - Has MFA secret? ❌ No (first time)
   ↓
7. ✅ ACCESS GRANTED to /mfa-setup
   ↓
8. Scan QR code → mfa_secret created
   ↓
9. Redirect to /verify-mfa
   ↓
10. Enter MFA code
    ↓
11. ✅ MFA verified → sessionStorage['mfa_verified'] = 'true'
    ↓
12. Can now access /vendor, /trailers, etc.
```

---

### Flow 2: Returning User (Tries to Access Onboarding Pages)

```
1. Log in successfully
   ↓
2. Redirect to /verify-mfa (MFA required)
   ↓
3. User tries to access /register or /mfa-setup (without entering code)
   ↓
   AuthGuard checks:
   - Session? ✅ Yes
   - Temp password allowed? ✅ Yes
   - Has MFA secret? ✅ YES (already set up)
   ↓
4. ❌ ACCESS DENIED - User has completed onboarding
   ↓
5. Redirect back to /verify-mfa
   ↓
6. User MUST enter MFA code to proceed
```

---

### Flow 3: User in Onboarding Tries to Access Production

```
1. Log in with temp password
   ↓
2. Complete /register (no MFA secret yet)
   ↓
3. User tries to access /vendor
   ↓
   AuthGuard checks:
   - Session? ✅ Yes
   - MFA required? ✅ Yes
   - MFA verified? ❌ No
   ↓
4. ❌ ACCESS DENIED - MFA not verified
   ↓
5. Redirect to /verify-mfa
   ↓
6. But user hasn't set up MFA yet! → Shows error or redirects to /mfa-setup
```

## AuthGuard Decision Matrix

| Condition | `onboardingOnly=false` | `onboardingOnly=true` |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **No Session** | ❌ Redirect to /login | ❌ Redirect to /login |
| **Temp Password** (not allowed) | ❌ Redirect to /password | ❌ Redirect to /password |
| **Has MFA Secret** (completed setup) | ✅ Allow (check MFA) | ❌ Redirect to /verify-mfa |
| **No MFA Secret** (in onboarding) | ✅ Allow (check MFA) | ✅ Allow |
| **MFA Not Verified** (requireMFA=true) | ❌ Redirect to /verify-mfa | N/A |
| **MFA Verified** | ✅ Allow | N/A |

[AUTH GUARD] ⚠️ User has completed onboarding (MFA secret exists)
[AUTH GUARD] ❌ Onboarding-only page not accessible, redirecting to /verify-mfa
```

### Accessing `/register` During Initial Onboarding

```
[AUTH GUARD] Checking authentication and authorization...
[AUTH GUARD] ✅ Session found: c14e61fc-8e0d-434e-aa31-68ac920950b6
[AUTH GUARD] Checking onboarding status (page is onboarding-only)...

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: New User Can Complete Onboarding

```bash
1. Log in with temporary password
2. Access /register
   → ✅ Should be allowed (no MFA secret yet)
3. Complete registration
4. Access /mfa-setup
   → ✅ Should be allowed (no MFA secret yet)
5. Scan QR code (creates MFA secret)
6. Redirected to /verify-mfa
7. Try to go back to /register or /mfa-setup
   → ❌ Should be BLOCKED (MFA secret exists)
   → Redirected to /verify-mfa
```

---

### ✅ Test 2: Returning User Cannot Access Onboarding

```bash
1. Log in (already has MFA setup)
2. Redirected to /verify-mfa
3. Try to navigate to /register (without entering MFA code)
   → ❌ Should be BLOCKED
   → Redirected back to /verify-mfa
4. Try to navigate to /mfa-setup (without entering MFA code)
   → ❌ Should be BLOCKED
   → Redirected back to /verify-mfa
5. Enter valid MFA code
6. Try to navigate to /register
   → ❌ Should still be BLOCKED (not an onboarding page)
   → Probably redirected back to home or stays on verify-mfa
```

---

### ✅ Test 3: URL Manipulation

```bash
1. Log in (already has MFA setup)
2. At /verify-mfa (don't enter code)
3. Manually type http://localhost:3000/register in URL bar
   → ❌ Should be BLOCKED
   → Console shows onboarding check
   → Redirected to /verify-mfa
4. Manually type http://localhost:3000/mfa-setup in URL bar
   → ❌ Should be BLOCKED
   → Console shows onboarding check
   → Redirected to /verify-mfa
```

---

## Summary

### Problem Fixed:
- ❌ Users at `/verify-mfa` could access `/register` and `/mfa-setup` without MFA
- ❌ This allowed bypassing MFA verification requirement

### Solution Applied:
- ✅ Added `onboardingOnly` prop to `AuthGuard`
- ✅ Checks if user has completed MFA setup (has `mfa_secret`)
- ✅ Blocks access to onboarding pages if MFA already set up
- ✅ Forces users to complete MFA verification before accessing any pages

### Security Improvements:
- 🔒 **Cannot bypass MFA** by navigating to onboarding pages
- 🔒 **Cannot access onboarding pages** after completing setup
- 🔒 **Must complete MFA verification** to access any protected content
- 🔒 **Onboarding is one-way** - can't go back once MFA is set up

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/auth-guard.tsx` - Added `onboardingOnly` logic
2. `app/register/page.tsx` - Added `onboardingOnly={true}`
3. `app/mfa-setup/page.tsx` - Added `onboardingOnly={true}`
