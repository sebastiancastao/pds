## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Why Hybrid Approach?
- **PDF:** Official tax forms require fillable PDFs for IRS/DOL compliance
- **Web Form:** Operational data better suited for database storage and analytics

### Why Rotated Fields?
- To match the layout of the original PDF document
- Improves readability when PDF is printed or viewed

### Data Separation
- **PDF data:** User manages (downloads, fills, submits manually)
- **Web form data:** System manages (stored in database, retrievable)
