# üîê Fix: Temporary Password Redirect Flow

## Issue Description

Users logging in with a temporary password were being redirected to `/verify-mfa` instead of `/password`. This violated the intended authentication flow where users MUST change their temporary password BEFORE proceeding to MFA verification.

## Root Cause

The login flow had the correct logic, but there were potential race conditions where:
1. The redirect to `/password` wasn't using `router.replace()`, allowing back navigation
2. No guard existed on `/verify-mfa` to prevent users with temporary passwords from accessing it
3. Session flags weren't being properly managed across redirects

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added **explicit check** for temporary password BEFORE any MFA checks
- ‚úÖ Changed `router.push()` to `router.replace()` for temporary password redirects
- ‚úÖ Added session flags to track password change requirements:
  - `requires_password_change` - Set when temporary password detected
  - Clear `mfa_checkpoint` and `mfa_verified` flags when redirecting to password change
- ‚úÖ Added early `return` after temporary password redirect to prevent any further logic execution

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Check temporary password FIRST before any MFA checks
if (isTemporaryPassword === true) {
  console.log('üîÑ [DEBUG] ‚úÖ REDIRECTING TO /password (temporary password detected)');
  console.log('üîÑ [DEBUG] User must change their temporary password BEFORE MFA');
  
  // Set flag to prevent redirect loops
  sessionStorage.setItem('requires_password_change', 'true');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('mfa_checkpoint'); // Clear any MFA checkpoint
  sessionStorage.removeItem('mfa_verified'); // Clear any MFA verification
  
  // Use replace to prevent back navigation
  router.replace('/password');
  return;
}
```

### 2. Password Change Page (`app/password/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Clear `requires_password_change` flag after successful password change
- ‚úÖ Properly redirect to `/mfa-setup` after password change (not `/verify-mfa`)

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Success!
setSuccess(true);

// Clear password change requirement flag
sessionStorage.removeItem('requires_password_change');
console.log('[DEBUG] Cleared requires_password_change flag');

// Redirect to MFA setup after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] Redirecting to /mfa-setup');
  router.push('/mfa-setup');
}, 2000);
```

### 3. MFA Verification Page (`app/verify-mfa/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added **guard** to check for temporary passwords on page load
- ‚úÖ Redirect users with temporary passwords back to `/password`
- ‚úÖ Only set `mfa_checkpoint` flag AFTER verifying no temporary password exists

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Check if user has temporary password BEFORE allowing MFA verification
const { data: userData } = await (supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('is_temporary_password, must_change_password')
  .eq('id', session.user.id)
  .single() as any);

if (userData?.is_temporary_password || userData?.must_change_password) {
  console.log('[DEBUG] ‚ùå User has temporary password - redirecting to /password');
  console.log('[DEBUG] User must change password BEFORE MFA verification');
  router.replace('/password');
  return;
}

// Set MFA checkpoint flag only after temporary password check passes
sessionStorage.setItem('mfa_checkpoint', 'true');
```

### 4. Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)

**No Changes Needed:**
- Already checks temporary password status FIRST (lines 38-42)
- Already redirects to `/password` before checking MFA

## Authentication Flow (Fixed)

### For Users with Temporary Password:
```
1. User logs in with temporary password
   ‚Üì
2. Login page detects is_temporary_password === true
   ‚Üì
3. Redirect to /password (using router.replace)
   ‚Üì
4. User changes password successfully
   ‚Üì
5. Redirect to /mfa-setup to set up MFA
   ‚Üì
6. After MFA setup, redirect to home (/)
```

### For Users with Normal Password:
```
1. User logs in with normal password
   ‚Üì
2. Login page detects is_temporary_password === false
   ‚Üì
3. Redirect to /verify-mfa (using router.replace)
   ‚Üì
4. User enters MFA code
   ‚Üì
5. After MFA verification, redirect to home (/)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User with temporary password logs in ‚Üí goes to `/password` ‚úÖ
- [ ] User tries to access `/verify-mfa` with temporary password ‚Üí redirected to `/password` ‚úÖ
- [ ] User changes password ‚Üí goes to `/mfa-setup` ‚úÖ
- [ ] User with normal password logs in ‚Üí goes to `/verify-mfa` ‚úÖ
- [ ] User completes MFA ‚Üí goes to home `/` ‚úÖ
- [ ] No redirect loops occur ‚úÖ

## Session Storage Flags

| Flag | Purpose | Set By | Cleared By |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| `requires_password_change` | User needs to change temporary password | Login page | Password page |
| `mfa_checkpoint` | User is in MFA verification process | verify-mfa page | Login redirect, MFA verification success |
| `mfa_verified` | User has completed MFA for this session | verify-mfa API | Logout, password change redirect |

## Database Fields Used

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `is_temporary_password` | boolean | Indicates if user's current password is temporary |
| `must_change_password` | boolean | Force password change flag (optional) |

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Temporary password users CANNOT bypass password change**
- Login page enforces redirect
- verify-mfa page blocks access
- Home page enforces redirect

‚úÖ **No navigation loopholes**
- Using `router.replace()` prevents back button bypass
- Session flags prevent direct URL access
- All entry points check temporary password status

‚úÖ **MFA only after password change**
- Users with temporary passwords complete password change first
- MFA setup happens AFTER password is permanent
- No MFA verification possible with temporary password

## Deployment

1. **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful
2. **Commit:** `d21dd84` - Fix: Ensure temporary password users redirect to /password before /verify-mfa
3. **Deployed to:** Vercel (auto-deployment)
4. **URL:** https://pds-murex.vercel.app

## Additional Notes

### Environment Variable Reminder

Don't forget to add this to Vercel environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://pds-murex.vercel.app
```

This ensures email links point to production URL instead of localhost.

### Debug Logging

All pages include detailed console logging for debugging:
- `[DEBUG]` prefix on all authentication flow logs
- Temporary password checks clearly logged
- Redirect decisions logged with reasoning
