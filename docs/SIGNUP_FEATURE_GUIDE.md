# üéØ Signup Feature - User Creation with Temporary Passwords

## Overview

The signup feature allows administrators to create one or multiple user accounts with secure temporary passwords that are automatically emailed to new users. This implements a secure, FLSA-compliant onboarding process for the PDS Time Tracking System.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Signup Page (`/signup`)
**File:** `app/signup/page.tsx`

A comprehensive UI for creating user accounts with:
- ‚úÖ Add multiple users at once (bulk creation)
- ‚úÖ Individual user forms with validation
- ‚úÖ Role selection (Worker, Manager, Finance, Executive)
- ‚úÖ Division selection (PDS Vendor, CWT Trailers, Both)
- ‚úÖ State selection (for state-specific onboarding packets)
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation
- ‚úÖ Success/error feedback with temporary passwords displayed
- ‚úÖ Copy-to-clipboard functionality for passwords
- ‚úÖ Security notices and compliance information

### 2. Signup API Route (`/api/auth/signup`)
**File:** `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

Secure server-side user creation with:
- ‚úÖ Cryptographically secure password generation (16 characters)
- ‚úÖ Supabase Auth user creation
- ‚úÖ Database user record creation

### 3. Email Utilities (`lib/email.ts`)
**File:** `lib/email.ts`

Professional email delivery system:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful HTML email template
- ‚úÖ Temporary password included securely
- ‚úÖ Expiration date clearly displayed
- ‚úÖ Security warnings and instructions
- ‚úÖ Direct login link

## üîê Security Features

### Temporary Password Generation

```typescript
// 16-character cryptographically secure password
// Includes: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
// Example: K7@mP9xR2#vN4wL8
```

**Characteristics:**
- 16 characters minimum
- At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z, excluding I, O)
- At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z, excluding l)
- At least 1 number (2-9, excluding 0, 1)
- At least 1 special character (!@#$%&*)
- Cryptographically random using Node.js `crypto` module
- Shuffled for additional randomness

### Password Expiration

- **Expiration Period:** 7 days from creation
- **Force Change:** User MUST change password on first login
- **Database Fields:**
  - `is_temporary_password`: `true`
  - `must_change_password`: `true`
  - `password_expires_at`: ISO timestamp (7 days future)

### Security Validations

1. **Email Validation:**
   - Format validation (RFC 5322 compliant)
   - Duplicate detection (within batch and database)
   - SQL injection prevention

2. **Input Sanitization:**
   - All inputs validated server-side
   - XSS protection
   - Special character handling

3. **Role & Division Validation:**
   - Enum validation (prevents invalid values)
   - Database constraints enforced

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Maximum 50 users per request
   - Future: Per-IP rate limiting

### Audit Trail

All user creation events are logged with:
- User ID
- Email
- Role
- Division
- State
- Created by (admin)
- Timestamp
- Success/failure status

### Email in Production

For production, integrate with your email provider:

**Option 1: Microsoft 365 (Recommended per your setup)**
```typescript
// Use Microsoft Graph API
// Already mentioned in your IT setup
```

**Option 2: SendGrid**
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Fields Added to `users` Table

These fields support temporary password functionality:

```sql
-- Temporary Password Management
is_temporary_password BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
must_change_password BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
password_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
last_password_change TIMESTAMPTZ,
```

### Verification

Check your `database/schema.sql` file includes these fields. If not, run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_temporary_password BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS must_change_password BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_password_change TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

## üß™ Testing the Signup Flow

### 1. Create a Test User

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/signup`

2. Fill in test data:
   ```
   First Name: Test
   Last Name: User
   Email: testuser@pds.com
   Role: Worker
   Division: PDS Vendor
   State: CA
   ```

3. Click "Create 1 User & Send Email"

4. Copy the temporary password from the success modal

### 2. Verify Email (Development)

Check your terminal/console for the simulated email output:

```
üìß EMAIL SENT (SIMULATED)
To: testuser@pds.com
[Full email content with temporary password]
```

### 3. Test Login

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/login`

2. Enter the email and temporary password

3. Verify you're redirected to password change page (future implementation)

### 4. Verify Database

Check the database to confirm user creation:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  role,
  division,
  is_temporary_password,
  must_change_password,
  password_expires_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'testuser@pds.com';
```

Expected result:
```
is_temporary_password: true
must_change_password: true
password_expires_at: [7 days from now]
```
