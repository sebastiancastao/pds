# ⚠️ Why Password "1234" Was Rejected

## Security Requirements (from .cursorrules)

Your password **"1234"** does not meet the required security standards:

| Requirement | "1234" | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Minimum 12 characters | 4 characters | ❌ FAIL |
| At least one uppercase letter | None | ❌ FAIL |
| At least one lowercase letter | None | ❌ FAIL |
| At least one number | Yes (1,2,3,4) | ✅ PASS |
| At least one special character | None | ❌ FAIL |

**Result:** Password rejected (fails 4 out of 5 requirements)

---

## 🔒 Why These Requirements Exist

### 1. **FLSA Compliance**
The Fair Labor Standards Act requires secure employee time tracking systems.

### 2. **SOC2 Compliance**
Security certification mandates strong password policies.

### 3. **PII Protection**
This system handles sensitive personal information (I-9, W-4, W-9, etc.).

### 4. **IRS/DOL Audit Requirements**
Weak passwords could lead to compliance failures during audits.

### 5. **Prevent Brute Force Attacks**
Simple passwords can be cracked in milliseconds:
- "1234" → 0.00001 seconds
- "Test123!@#" → 41 million years

## 💡 Password Strength Examples

### ❌ Weak Passwords (Will Be Rejected)
```
1234
password
admin123
qwerty
12345678
```

### ✅ Strong Passwords (Will Be Accepted)
```
Test123!@#
Secure$Pass2024
MyP@ssw0rd123
Admin!2024$Pwd
PDS#Vendor2024!
```

## 🔐 Password Best Practices

1. **Use a Password Manager** (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden)
2. **Never Reuse Passwords** across different systems
3. **Enable MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication)
4. **Change Passwords Regularly** (every 90 days for sensitive systems)
5. **Avoid Personal Information** (names, birthdays, etc.)

## 🛡️ Account Security Features

Your account includes:
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- ✅ Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ MFA support (TOTP + backup codes)
- ✅ Session management with auto-timeout
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent brute force

---

## 📞 Need Help?

**To change your password later:**
1. Use the password reset flow (will be implemented)
2. Or update directly in database (for testing):

```sql
UPDATE public.profiles
SET password_hash = crypt('YourNewPassword123!', gen_salt('bf', 12))
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'sebastiancastao379@gmail.com');
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This test account has **Executive** role (full system access)
- MFA is **not enabled yet** (set up on first login)
- For **production**, always use strong passwords
- Change this password after testing
- Never commit passwords to Git
