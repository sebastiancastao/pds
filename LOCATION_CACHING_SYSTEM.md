# 📍 Location Caching System

## Overview

The geofencing system now uses a **two-tier caching strategy** to prevent location permission from expiring too quickly while maintaining security.

---

## 🎯 Caching Strategy

### Tier 1: Browser Cache (5 minutes)
**What:** Browser's internal geolocation cache  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Configuration:** `maximumAge: 300000` in `lib/geofence.ts`

**How it works:**
- When you request location, the browser can return a cached GPS position if it's less than 5 minutes old
- This avoids triggering GPS hardware repeatedly
- Improves battery life and performance
- User doesn't see any difference

### Tier 2: localStorage Cache (1 hour)
**What:** Application-level cache in browser storage  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Configuration:** In `app/login/page.tsx`

**How it works:**
- After getting location successfully, it's stored in localStorage with a timestamp
- When you refresh the page or come back later, it checks if cached location is less than 1 hour old
- If valid, uses cached location automatically - no button click needed!
- If expired (>1 hour), asks for fresh location

## 📊 User Experience

### First Visit:
```
1. User loads login page
2. Sees "Allow Location Access" button
3. Clicks button
4. Browser asks for permission
5. User taps "Allow"
6. Location obtained and cached (1 hour)
7. "Sign In" button enabled
```

### Returning Within 1 Hour:
```
1. User loads login page
2. ✓ Location automatically restored from cache
3. Shows: "✓ Location verified (cached 5min ago)"
4. "Sign In" button immediately enabled
5. NO button click needed! 🎉
```

### After 1 Hour:
```
1. User loads login page
2. Cache expired (>1 hour old)
3. Sees "Allow Location Access" button again
4. Clicks button
5. Location obtained (browser may use 5-min cache)
6. New 1-hour cache started
```

---

## 🔄 Cache Management

### Automatic Cache Clearing:

**Cache expires automatically after:**
- ✅ 1 hour since location was obtained
- ✅ Browser clears localStorage (unlikely)
- ✅ User clears browsing data

### Manual Cache Clearing:

**User clicks "Refresh" button:**
```javascript
1. Clears localStorage cache immediately
2. Resets UI state
3. Requests fresh location from GPS
4. New cache created with current timestamp
```

**Use cases for manual refresh:**
- User moved to different location
- User wants to verify current position
- Testing geofencing boundaries

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Why Not Cache Forever?

**Security reasons:**
1. **Location can change:** User might move outside geofence
2. **Session hijacking:** Stolen localStorage shouldn't work indefinitely
3. **Compliance:** Regular verification shows due diligence
4. **Best practice:** Periodic re-validation is industry standard

### Why 1 Hour?

**Balance between:**
- ✅ **User Experience:** Don't annoy users with constant prompts
- ✅ **Security:** Regular enough to prevent abuse
- ✅ **Compliance:** Reasonable re-verification interval
- ✅ **Real-world usage:** Most login sessions happen within 1 hour

### Can I Change the Duration?

**Yes!** Edit `app/login/page.tsx`:

```javascript
// Find this line (around line 34):
const oneHour = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour in milliseconds

// Change to your preferred duration:
const twoHours = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000;     // 2 hours
const thirtyMinutes = 30 * 60 * 1000;     // 30 minutes
const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;       // 24 hours (not recommended for security)
```

**Recommended durations:**
- **High security:** 30 minutes
- **Balanced (current):** 1 hour ✅
- **Convenience:** 2-4 hours
- **Maximum recommended:** 8 hours (work shift)

## 💾 localStorage Keys

The system stores three keys in browser localStorage:

```javascript
// Key 1: Permission granted flag
localStorage.getItem('pds_location_granted')
// Value: 'true' | null

// Key 2: Coordinates
localStorage.getItem('pds_user_location')
// Value: JSON string like '{"latitude":3.550032,"longitude":-76.614169,"accuracy":15}'

// Key 3: Timestamp
localStorage.getItem('pds_location_timestamp')
// Value: String number like '1696950000000' (milliseconds since epoch)
```

### Viewing Cache in Browser:

**Chrome/Edge/Samsung Browser:**
1. F12 → Application tab → Storage → Local Storage
2. Find your domain
3. Look for keys starting with `pds_location_`

**Firefox:**
1. F12 → Storage tab → Local Storage
2. Find your domain

---

## 🧪 Testing Cache Behavior

### Test 1: Cache Creation
```
1. Clear browser localStorage (F12 → Application → Clear)
2. Refresh login page
3. Click "Allow Location Access"
4. Check localStorage - should see 3 keys
5. Check timestamp - should be current time
```

### Test 2: Cache Retrieval
```
1. After Test 1, refresh the page
2. Should immediately show "✓ Location verified (cached 0min ago)"
3. No button click needed
4. Sign In button should be enabled
```

### Test 3: Cache Expiry
```
1. In browser console, run:
   localStorage.setItem('pds_location_timestamp', Date.now() - (2 * 60 * 60 * 1000))
   // Sets timestamp to 2 hours ago
2. Refresh page
3. Should show "Allow Location Access" button (cache expired)
4. localStorage should be cleared
```

### Test 4: Manual Refresh
```
1. Get location (see green verified box)
2. Click "Refresh" button
3. Console should show: "User clicked Refresh - clearing cache"
4. Should request fresh location
5. New timestamp created
```

## 📱 Mobile Browser Behavior

### Samsung Browser:
- localStorage persists across sessions ✅
- Works in normal and secret mode
- Cleared when "Delete browsing data" is used

### Chrome Mobile:
- localStorage persists ✅
- Incognito mode has separate storage (doesn't persist)

### Safari iOS:
- localStorage persists ✅
- Private mode has separate storage
- May clear if storage is full (rare)

---

## 🔍 Debugging Cache Issues

### Check Cache Status:

Open browser console on login page:

```javascript
// Check if cache exists
const granted = localStorage.getItem('pds_location_granted');
const coords = localStorage.getItem('pds_user_location');
const timestamp = localStorage.getItem('pds_location_timestamp');

console.log('Granted:', granted);
console.log('Coords:', coords);
console.log('Timestamp:', timestamp);

// Check age
if (timestamp) {
  const age = Date.now() - parseInt(timestamp);
  const minutes = Math.round(age / 60000);
  console.log(`Cache age: ${minutes} minutes`);
  console.log(`Valid for: ${60 - minutes} more minutes`);
}
```

### Force Fresh Location:

```javascript
// Clear cache manually
localStorage.removeItem('pds_location_granted');
localStorage.removeItem('pds_user_location');
localStorage.removeItem('pds_location_timestamp');
location.reload();
```

## 📊 Cache Hit Rate

**Expected behavior:**
- **First visit:** Cache miss → request location
- **Refresh within 1h:** Cache hit → instant ✅
- **Multiple logins in 1h:** All cache hits ✅
- **After 1h:** Cache miss → request fresh

**Typical user:**
- Logs in once per session
- Cache hit rate: ~80-90%
- Reduced location requests by 80%

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working (Always Asks for Location):

**Check console for:**
```
📍 [CACHE] Error reading cached location
```

**Common causes:**
1. localStorage disabled in browser settings
2. Incognito/private mode
3. Browser security extension blocking storage
4. Corrupted cache data

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Clear and try again
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Cache Never Expires:

**Check:**
1. System clock is correct
2. Timestamp is a valid number
3. No JavaScript errors in console

### Location Always Cached (Even After 1+ Hour):

**Check:**
```javascript
const timestamp = localStorage.getItem('pds_location_timestamp');
const age = Date.now() - parseInt(timestamp);
console.log('Age in hours:', age / (60 * 60 * 1000));
```

If age shows > 1 hour but still using cache, there's a bug. Clear cache and report.
